TimelessScholars is a simple e-learning platform that helps students explore high-quality educational content in one place.

> **Important :** The platform does **NOT** host any paid courses or sell any material.  
It only provides **reference links** to publicly available YouTube video lectures, documents, and notes — without violating copyright.

## 🚀 What this Platform Does

- provides subject-wise curated video lecture links from famous educators
- provides notes / PDF documents / reference material
- helps students access everything in a single platform
- notifies students when well-known lecturers go LIVE
- useful mainly for local institute / college level students

## 🧠 Why this Platform?

Today, students spend a lot of time searching for correct lecture videos and genuine notes.

This platform solves that problem by:

- collecting quality video links
- filtering unnecessary content

- making navigation easier

So students can **save time** and **study smarter** ✅
